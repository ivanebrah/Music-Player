🎧 Music Player

> A handcrafted, browser-based music player that merges elegant UI design with real-time audio control. Built for the web, inspired by mobile, and engineered with precision.

---

Overview

> This project is a fully functional music player built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It simulates the experience of a modern mobile music app—complete with animated album transitions, a custom phone frame UI, and interactive controls. The goal was to create a responsive, immersive audio interface without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

> Whether you're toggling shuffle, scrubbing through a track, or just admiring the animated background, every interaction is handled natively and intentionally.

Architecture & Design

- UI Layer: Structured with semantic HTML and styled with modular CSS. The layout mimics a mobile device using a custom phone frame and layered backgrounds.
- Audio Engine: Powered by the HTML5 `<audio>` API, with dynamic playlist management, volume control, and playback state tracking.
- State Management: Lightweight state logic handles shuffle, repeat, and track transitions without external dependencies.
- Visual Effects: Background animations (floating dots, album transitions) are rendered using DOM manipulation and CSS animations for performance and aesthetic depth.
